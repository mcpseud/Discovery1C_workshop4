    "# Workshop 4: How can we slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Workshop 3 you explored a model for the spread of antimicrobial resistance in a hospital and wrote a function to allocate antibiotics within the hospital. Your goal in that workshop was to allocate antibiotics to patients in such a way that the evolution of AMR was slowed and deaths among patients minimised. In this workshop we will build upon what you did last week to further understand how we can slow the spread of AMR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you will be given some example functions for allocating antibiotics in the model. However, you will not be given any information about what these functions do other than being given the code. Your task will be to write a description of how what these functions are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, you will compare the performance of these functions to each other and to the function that you devised last week. You will also examine how different parameters affect the relative performance of each function, and explain why each function is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write an explanation of supplied function code\n",
    "* Compare function behaviour across a range of paramter values using loops\n",
    "* Understand how using multiple drugs can help slow resistance evolution and reduce deaths\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working as a group\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task today is as much conceptual as a coding task. **Discuss your code, ideas and answers with other members of the group.** Peer assistance (not copying answers but talking through your approaches to the problem) can help avoid you getting stuck, increase how much you learn from the session and make it more enjoyable.\n",

    "# Importing and looping the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick reminder of how our model works:\n",
    "* In the model there are two different antibiotics that can be used by doctors in the hospital, drug A and drug B.\n",
    "* The bacteria can have four different types:\n",
    "    1. Sensitive to both antibiotics (`sensitive`)\n",
    "    2. Resistant to drug A and sensitive to drug B (`resistant_A`)\n",
    "    3. Resistant to drug B and sensitive to drug A (`resistant_B`)\n",
    "    4. Resistant to both drugs (`resistant_AB`).\n",
    "* Drug A is better at killing the bacteria, helping patients clear their infection twice as fast as drug B when the infecting bacteria are sensitive to it (efficacy drug A = 0.01, effiacy drug B = 0.005).\n",
    "* Both drugs carry a cost of resistance for the bacteria.\n",
    "* The infection is potentially lethal, with each infected patient having a 1% chance of dying each day.\n",
    "* The model will simulate 5,000 days every time that you run it.\n",
    "* Each simulation will begin with only sensitive bacteria, but resistance to both drugs will begin to appear by mutation.\n",
    "* How fast resistance to each drug will spread will depend on how antibiotics are allocated during the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will import a slightly different version of the model which will allow you to pass the model values for the parameters of the efficacies of drug A and drug B and the cost of resistance. This will allow you to explore how these parameters effect the outcome of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we'll load the module `AMR_model` that contains the model along with some other modules that we'll need today."

However, above a cost value of 0.005 there is no further decline in deaths. This makes sense as the efficacy of drug B is 0.005, so at this point the cost of resistance completely cancels out the benefit of resistance, so resistance never evolves when the cost is greater than 0.005. We can see this by comparing the dynamics of the model when "
